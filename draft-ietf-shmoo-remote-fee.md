--- abstract

This document outlines a principle for open participation that extends the open process
principle defined in RFC3935 by stating that there must be a free option for online
participation to IETF meetings and, if possible, related IETF-hosted events over the Internet.

# Introduction

Remote participation for IETF in-person meetings has evolved over time from email-only
to live chat and audio streaming, and, subsequently, to a full online meeting system that is tightly integrated
with the in-room session and enables interactive participation by audio and video.
Remote participation has historically been free for remote attendees.

Given this more full-blown participation option, the IETF has started seeing an increasing number
of remote participants. This increase can be explained by the ease with which
new participants can join a meeting or only attend selected parts of the meeting agenda, and also by 
a less strongly perceived need to attend every meeting in person, due to either financial
reasons or other circumstances. In order to better understand
these trends, the IETF started requiring registration for remote participation, still without any registration fee applied.

With the move to fully online meetings in 2020 and 2021, however, there was no longer a
distinction between remote and on-site participants for those meetings.
Since IETF meeting costs and other costs still had to be covered, a meeting fee was charged for
remote participants, eliminating the free remote participation
option (for a time).

The introduction of a fee for remote participation raised concerns about the potential impact on both, those who
regularly remotely attend IETF meetings and those people considering 
attending an IETF meeting for the first time. In both cases, even a small
registration fee can be a barrier to participation.

# Principle of Open Participation

This document outlines the principle of open participation that the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC)
is expected to incorporate into decisions about the registration fee structure for remote participation.

The principle this document states is simple: there must be an option for free
remote participation in any IETF meeting, regardless of whether the meeting has a physical presence.
Related events collocated with an IETF meeting are part of the IETF's open process [RFC3935] and
are encouraged to follow this principle as well, if they offer remote participation at all.

This principle aims to support the openness principle of the IETF as defined in {{RFC3935}}:

"Open process - any interested person can participate in the work,
   know what is being decided, and make his or her voice heard on the
   issue.  Part of this principle is our commitment to making our
   documents, our WG mailing lists, our attendance lists, and our
   meeting minutes publicly available on the Internet."
   
While RFC3935 explicitly notes that this principle includes a requirement to open 
basically all our documents and material and to make them accessible over the Internet, it was
written with mainly having email interactions in mind when talking about participation.
This document extends this principle to explicitly cover remote
participation at meetings. Particularly in this context, openness should be seen as open and free. 

This document does not stipulate that all IETF meetings or related IETF events must have a remote participation option,
because there could be technical or other reasons why that might not always be possible.
This document rather states that if remote participation is provided,
there should always be a free option to make the process as open as possible. Having said that,
it is of course strongly anticipated that at least all working group sessions as well as BoFs
and the administrative plenary of an IETF meeting provide an option for remote participation.

Moreover, a free remote
participation option must offer the same functionality available to paid remote participants. In addition, it must not
be possible to identify participants that used the free option and any data collected in administerting this option must be confidential. The free remote participation option
must be clearly shown on the meeting website and
registration page and the process to obtain a free registration should be explained.

# Financial Impact

Fully online meetings as well as remote participation incur expenses, as do other services that the IETF provides.
This includes items such as mailing lists, document access via the datatracker or other
online platforms, as well as support for videoconferencing, like use of Meetecho and others.
Meeting fees are a way to distribute these and other operating costs of the IETF among participants,
even though they do not fully offset the costs of either holding the meeting or operating the IETF.
As such, the intention of this document and the principle stated herein is not to make remote participation
free for everyone, but to always offer a free remote option that enables remote participation without
any barriers other than the application for the free registration itself for those where the registration fee
is a barrier for participation.
This principle applies to remote participation only, providing thereby one free option for participation.
In-person participation is not in scope for this document as the costs considerations 
are broader than just the registration fee.

It is not in scope for this document to make suggestions for changing
the IETF's fee structure or overall funding model. As defined in the RFC871
it is the IETF LLC’s responsibility to manage IETF’s finances and budget and
as such “[t]he IETF LLC is expected to act responsibly so as to minimize risks
to IETF participants and to the future of the IETF as a whole, such as financial
risks.” Further, it is the responsibility of the IETF LLC Board  "to act
consistently with the documented consensus of the IETF community" {{?RFC871}},
taking agreed principles like the one proposed in this document into account.

If unlimited free remote participation is determined to adversely affect 
financial sustainability of the IETF e.g. if the number of paying participants
or the cost of free participation emerges to be a signification factor,
the LLC is expected to implement additional measures to manage these costs.
This document does not and cannot restrict the LLC in its financial responsibility
and therefore does not impose any limitation on the use of appropriate measures.
If the LLC decides to do this, they should make their decision and rationale known to the community
and consider community consultation as specified in Section 4.4 of RFC8711
in oder “to obtain consensus-based community input on key issues”. 
Further, they should describe the implemented process in sufficient detail for
participants to make an informed decsion about the use of the free option.

As discussed in the next section, assessment of eligibility is difficult and consequently any limit
on the number of available free registrations, which likely requires an assessment of eligibility,
can cause unfairness and negatively impact openness which should be considered seriously in any LLC decision.
As such, this document defines the principle of free participation but leaves
room for choices in the implementation by the LLC. Specifically, it cannot provide
guidance on appropriate measures against misuse as any measures need to
be adapted to the specific problem in a specific situation in order to minimise both the
financial risk as well as its impact on openness and inclusivity.


# Considerations on Use and Misuse of a Free Participation Option

This document does not provide specific requirements on when it is appropriate
for an IETF community member to use or not use the free option to remotely attend a meeting. The purpose of
the free option is to enable everybody who is interested in participation to join meetings without the meeting
fee imposing a financial barrier. These cases cannot be limited to a certain group, like students or "self-funded"
participants, nor to any specific other restrictions like the number of meetings previously attended or previous level of involvement.
The purpose is simply to maximise participation without barriers in order to make the standards process as open as possible.

It is expected that participants who have financial support to use the paid regular registration option 
will do so. Paying a registration fee is a way for their sponsor to support the sustainability of the IETF. 
For example, a higher late payment charge can be used to maximise this financial support. 
However, this document does not comment on the actual payment structure 
of the IETF meeting fee other than the requirement for a free option. The fee payment structure is set the by the IETF LLC such that
the viability of the IETF and the need of IETF participants to work productively within the IETF can be warranted.

The LLC is responsible to ensure the financial stability of the IETF and therefore should monitor
trends in the use of the free participation option that could endanger the viability of the IETF and, if necessary, manage the associated costs.
Aggregated data on the number and percentage of free registrations used should be published,
as this will permit analysis of the use and change in use over time of the free registration option without
revealing personal information. 

As the principle defined in this document aims to promote openness and thereby enhance participation,
an increase in use of free registrations is a success and likely a sign of increased interest and not necessarily a
sign of misuse, specifically as long as the number of paid registrations stays reasonably stable.
If the number of paid registrations decreases, however,
this can be due to various reasons other than misuse,
such as restrictions on travel to physical meetings due to cost savings or environmental reasons, general cost
savings and lesser focus on standardization work, or simply loss of business interest. Such trends
can impact the sustainability of the IETF due to its
dependency on meetings fees to cross-finance other costs, independent of use of the free registrations.
